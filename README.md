These are some lines of python code for data analysis of a youtube dataset. The goal is to find out wether a video in the youtube trends was positively or negatively trending.
For this data analysis I use a dataset from kaggle.com. The dataset contains every video which was listed as trending in a time of 205 days.



<!--
## exploratory analysis
* time series of likes and views

## inferential analysis
* infer likes/views at current time from the existing data
